OUTPUT: 
  First program prints "Hello" 2 times
  Seconmd one - "Hello" once in the parent process

EXPLANATION:
  1. The point here is that stdout is LINE-BUFFERED when it points to a terminal. Consider the Program 1.

  2. printf("Hello");  has no newline. 
  
  3. During fork(); memory spaces of child and parent processes are identical.
  
  4. Therefore, in program 1, both parent and child will print "Hello".
