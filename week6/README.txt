Hello!

Please pay attention that comments are present in each .c file.

Some test are provided. 
They are in the form test"exercise number"_"test number".txt
The first one is the same for all 3 scheduling algorithms.

This test shows that: 
 1) FCFS has the worst performance
 2) SJN has intermediate performance
 3) Round-robin has the best performance

>> SJN is more effective than FCFS 
    since it takes the fastest job first 
    in order to decrease average waiting time and hence average turn around time

>> Round-robin appears to be more effective than previous two
    since each process gets an equal share of the CPU,
    hence average waiting time and hence average turn around time
    can be decreased even more IF the appropriate quantum will 
    be chosen for the problem (however, it is not always the case)

Have a nice day!
